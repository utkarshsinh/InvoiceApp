Addresses\n *     https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk/issues/1548\n * 4.  Multi-Tab Support.\n * 5.  Removal of held write acks.\n * 6.

Add collection-parent index for Collection Group queries.\n * 9.  Change RemoteDocumentChanges store to be keyed by readTime rather than\n *     an auto-incrementing ID. This is required for Index-Free queries.\n * 10. Rewrite the canonical IDs to the explicit Protobuf-based format.\n * 11.

Unfortunately, IndexedDB cannot be reliably used in window.unload\n * since it is an asynchronous API. So in addition to attempting to give up the\n * lease, the leaseholder writes its client ID to a \"zombiedClient\" entry in\n * LocalStorage which acts as an indicator that another tab should go ahead and\n * take the primary lease immediately regardless of the current lease timestamp.\n *\n * TODO(b/114226234): Remove `synchronizeTabs` section when multi-tab is no\n * longer optional.\n */ /**\n * Helper to get a typed SimpleDbStore for the primary client object store.\n */function Ri(t){return Rr(t,nr.store);}/**\n * Helper to get a typed SimpleDbStore for the client metadata object store.\n */function Li(t){return Rr(t,pr.store);}/**\n * Generates a string used as a prefix when storing data in IndexedDB and\n * LocalStorage.\n */function Oi(t,e){// Use two different prefix formats:\n//   * firestore / persistenceKey / projectID . databaseID / ...\n//   * firestore / persistenceKey / projectID / ...\n// projectIDs are DNS-compatible names and cannot contain dots\n// so there's no danger of collisions.\nvar n=t.projectId;return t.isDefaultDatabase||(n+=\".\"+t.database),\"firestore/\"+e+\"/\"+n+\"/\"/**\n * @license\n * Copyright 2020 Google LLC\n *\n * Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n * you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n * You may obtain a copy of the License at\n *\n *   http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n *\n * Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n * distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n * WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n * See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n * limitations under the License.\n */;}var Pi=function(t,e){this.progress=t,this.wn=e;},Fi=/** @class */function(){function t(t,e,n){this.Ue=t,this._n=e,this.Ut=n/**\n     * Get the local view of the document identified by `key`.\n     *\n     * @returns Local view of the document or null if we don't have any cached\n     * state for it.\n     */;}return t.prototype.mn=function(t,e){var n=this;return this._n.getAllMutationBatchesAffectingDocumentKey(t,e).next(function(r){return n.yn(t,e,r);});},/** Internal version of `getDocument` that allows reusing batches. */t.prototype.yn=function(t,e,n){return this.Ue.getEntry(t,e).next(function(t){for(var e=0,r=n;e<r.length;e++){r[e].applyToLocalView(t);}return t;});},// Returns the view of the given `docs` as they would appear after applying\n// all mutations in the given `batches`.\nt.prototype.gn=function(t,e){t.forEach(function(t,n){for(var r=0,i=e;r<i.length;r++){i[r].applyToLocalView(n);}});},/**\n     * Gets the local view of the documents identified by `keys`.\n     *\n     * If we don't have cached state for a document in `keys`, a NoDocument will\n     * be stored for that key in the resulting set.\n     */t.prototype.pn=function(t,e){var n=this;return this.Ue.getEntries(t,e).next(function(e){return n.En(t,e).next(function(){return e;});});},/**\n     * Applies the local view the given `baseDocs` without retrieving documents\n     * from the local store.\n     */t.prototype.En=function(t,e){var n=this;return this._n.getAllMutationBatchesAffectingDocumentKeys(t,e).next(function(t){return n.gn(e,t);});},/**\n     * Performs a query against the local view of all documents.\n     *\n     * @param transaction -

Data is stored persistently\n * across sessions.\n *\n * On Web only, the Firestore SDKs support shared access to its persistence\n * layer. This allows multiple browser tabs to read and write to IndexedDb and\n * to synchronize state even without network connectivity. Shared access is\n * currently optional and not enabled unless all clients invoke\n * `enablePersistence()` with `{synchronizeTabs:true}`.\n *\n * In multi-tab mode, if multiple clients are active at the same time, the SDK\n * will designate one client as the “primary client”. An effort is made to pick\n * a visible, network-connected and active client, and this client is\n * responsible for letting other clients know about its presence. The primary\n * client writes a unique client-generated identifier (the client ID) to\n * IndexedDb’s “owner” store every 4 seconds. If the primary client fails to\n * update this entry, another client can acquire the lease and take over as\n * primary.\n *\n * Some persistence operations in the SDK are designated as primary-client only\n * operations. This includes the acknowledgment of mutations and all updates of\n * remote documents. The effects of these operations are written to persistence\n * and then broadcast to other tabs via LocalStorage (see\n * `WebStorageSharedClientState`), which then refresh their state from\n * persistence.\n *\n * Similarly, the primary client listens to notifications sent by secondary\n * clients to discover persistence changes written by secondary clients, such as\n * the addition of new mutations and query targets.\n *\n * If multi-tab is not enabled and another tab already obtained the primary\n * lease, IndexedDbPersistence enters a failed state and all subsequent\n * operations will automatically fail.\n *\n * Additionally, there is an optimization so that when a tab is closed, the\n * primary lease is released immediately (this is especially important to make\n * sure that a refreshed tab is able to immediately re-acquire the primary\n * lease). Unfortunately, IndexedDB cannot be reliably used in window.unload\n * since it is an asynchronous API. So in addition to attempting to give up the\n * lease, the leaseholder writes its client ID to a \"zombiedClient\" entry in\n * LocalStorage which acts as an indicator that another tab should go ahead and\n * take the primary lease immediately regardless of the current lease timestamp.\n *\n * TODO(b/114226234): Remove `synchronizeTabs` section when multi-tab is no\n * longer optional.\n */\nclass ki {\n    constructor(\n    /**\n     * Whether to synchronize the in-memory state of multiple tabs and share\n     * access to local persistence.\n     */\n    t, e, n, s, i, r, o, c, u, \n    /**\n     * If set to true, forcefully obtains database access.
